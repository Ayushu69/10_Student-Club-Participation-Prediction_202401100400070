# 10_Student-Club-Participation-Prediction_202401100400070
🧠 Student Club Participation Prediction:
  This project uses machine learning to predict whether a student will join a club based on their interest level and available free time. It's a binary classification problem solved using a Random Forest Classifier.

📌 Problem Statement:
  Redicting student participation in clubs can help institutions plan better and increase engagement. This model uses a student’s Interest Level and Free Hours per Week to predict if they will say yes or no to joining a club.

🚀 Technologies Used:
  Python,
  pandas,
  scikit-learn,
  seaborn,
  matplotlib

🔍 Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

  Encoded categorical values (yes → 1, no → 0)
  
  Selected key features for training
  
Model Selection:

  Used a Random Forest Classifier for classification
  
  Split dataset: 80% training, 20% testing

Evaluation:

  Confusion Matrix
  
  Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores
  
  Visualized matrix using a heatmap
  
📚 Future Work:

  Add more features (e.g., past participation, academic performance)
  
  Try other ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
  
  Build a web app with Flask or Streamlit for interactive prediction
